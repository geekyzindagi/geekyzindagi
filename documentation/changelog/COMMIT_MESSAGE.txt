feat: advanced branding, live github metrics, and multidisciplinary expansion

Summary of Engineering & Design Progress (modifications branch):

1. Advanced Visual Identity:
- Unified Brand: Centralized 'Logo' component with animated Rose-Indigo gradients and textured drop-shadows.
- Hero Redesign: Implemented a compact, horizontal HeroNotion section with responsive typewriter effects and adaptive floating illustrations.
- Integrated across all 4 Navbar & 5 Footer variants for 100% brand consistency.

2. Real-Time Data & Performance:
- GitHub Metric Sync: Added real-time fetching of stars and forks in 'lib/github.ts' for social proof on the /projects page.
- Performance Architecture: Built an in-memory TTL caching layer to eliminate 600ms+ API latency, enabling sub-100ms page loads.

3. 'Full Spectrum of Life' Ecosystem:
- Expanded Domain Registry: Integrated Quantum Computing, Consciousness, Gardening, Sports, and Culinary Arts into core schemas.
- Visual Propagation: updated DomainsAlive (Parallax), DomainsBento, DomainsNotion, and DomainsMinimal to reflect the new disciplines.

4. Governance & Infrastructure:
- CI/CD: Automated lint/build validation via '.github/workflows/ci.yml'.
- Documentation: Major README updates highlighting the shift to a multidisciplinary platform.
- Schema Optimization: Updated Prisma and Zod validations for the expanded tag ecosystem.

Impact: 46 files updated, +2551 LOC. Focus on multidisciplinary scale and production performance.
